# Retirement Planning System - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The retirement planning codebase has been refactored from a monolithic structure into a modular, object-oriented architecture with fine-grained classes designed for easy iteration and extensibility.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **Before**: Single large files (`retirement_simulator.py`, `scenario_runner.py`)
- **After**: Organized module structure with clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Fine-Grained Classes**
Each responsibility is now handled by a dedicated class:

#### Core Domain Models (`src/core/`)
- `base.py` - Abstract base classes (Entity, ValueObject, Calculator, Strategy)
- `money.py` - Immutable Money value object with currency support
- `portfolio.py` - Portfolio entity with asset management
- `withdrawal.py` - Withdrawal strategy implementations
- `returns.py` - Return calculation engines
- `simulator.py` - Monte Carlo simulation engine

### 3. **Design Patterns Applied**

#### Strategy Pattern
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: `WithdrawalStrategy` base with multiple implementations
  - `FixedPercentageWithdrawal` (4% rule)
  - `DynamicPercentageWithdrawal` (adaptive)
  - `GuardrailWithdrawal` (bounded)

- **Return Calculators**: `ReturnCalculator` base with implementations
  - `MonteCarloReturns`
  - `HistoricalReturns`
  - `RegimeBasedReturns`

#### Value Object Pattern
- `Money` class for handling monetary values immutably
- `AllocationTarget` for portfolio allocations

#### Entity Pattern
- `Portfolio` as a domain entity with identity
- Clear separation between entities and value objects

### 4. **Benefits of New Structure**

#### Easier Iteration
- Each component can be modified independently
- New strategies can be added without changing existing code
- Clear interfaces make testing easier

#### Better Testability
- Small, focused classes are easier to unit test
- Mock implementations can be easily created
- Dependencies are explicit

#### Improved Maintainability
- Single Responsibility Principle - each class has one reason to change
- Open/Closed Principle - extend behavior without modifying existing code
- Dependency Inversion - depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 5. **Usage Examples**

#### Simple Simulation
```python
from retirement_planner import RetirementPlanner

planner = RetirementPlanner()
results = planner.create_simple_scenario(
    initial_portfolio=Decimal('1000000'),
    annual_withdrawal=Decimal('40000'),
    years=30
)
print(f"Success Rate: {results.success_rate:.1f}%")
```

#### Custom Strategy
```python
from core.withdrawal import DynamicPercentageWithdrawal
from core.returns import RegimeBasedReturns

# Create custom withdrawal strategy
withdrawal = DynamicPercentageWithdrawal(
    base_rate=Decimal('4'),
    min_rate=Decimal('3'),
    max_rate=Decimal('6')
)

# Create regime-based returns
returns = RegimeBasedReturns(
    bull_params=(Decimal('0.15'), Decimal('0.12')),
    bear_params=(Decimal('-0.05'), Decimal('0.25')),
    normal_params=(Decimal('0.07'), Decimal('0.15'))
)
```

### 6. **Extension Points**

The new architecture makes it easy to add:

#### New Withdrawal Strategies
Simply extend `WithdrawalStrategy` and implement `calculate_withdrawal()`

#### New Return Models
Extend `ReturnCalculator` and implement `calculate_return()`

#### New Asset Types
Add to the `Asset` class or create specialized asset subclasses

#### New Simulation Types
Create new simulation parameters and result types

### 7. **File Structure**

```

## Migration Guide

### From Old Code to New

#### Old Way:
```python
params = RetirementParams(
    initial_portfolio=1_000_000,
    annual_withdrawal=40_000,
    years_in_retirement=30
)
simulator = RetirementSimulator(params)
```

#### New Way:
```python
planner = RetirementPlanner()
results = planner.create_simple_scenario(
    initial_portfolio=Decimal('1000000'),
    annual_withdrawal=Decimal('40000'),
    years=30
)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unit Tests** - Create comprehensive test suite for all modules
2. **Add Persistence** - Implement repository pattern for saving simulations
3. **Add Validation** - Create validators for input parameters
4. **Add Factories** - Implement factory pattern for complex object creation
5. **Add Events** - Implement event system for simulation lifecycle
6. **Add Caching** - Cache simulation results for performance
7. **Add Logging** - Comprehensive logging throughout the system

## Conclusion

The refactored codebase provides a solid foundation for iterative development with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible design patterns
- Fine-grained, focused classes
- Easy testing and mocking
- Better maintainability

Each component can now be developed, tested, and deployed independently, making the system much more flexible for future enhancements.

The "cascade" is really about WHERE you take money from:

1. ALWAYS withdraw living expenses from Bucket 1 (safe money)
2. ONLY refill Bucket 1 from profits/gains in other buckets
3. NEVER sell from Buckets 2 or 3 in down markets

In practice, you would:
- Quarterly: Check if Bucket 1 needs refilling
- Annually: Do a full rebalance cascade
- When assets arrive: Strategically allocate to depleted buckets

The portfolio builder doesn't do this automatically - YOU manage it by:
- Setting up accounts as shown
- Manually rebalancing when needed
- Using new money (private stock, inheritance) to refill

This is more of a MENTAL FRAMEWORK than automated system!

    print("""
The bucket strategy is really a MENTAL FRAMEWORK for managing withdrawals:

1. It's NOT automatically implemented by the code
2. You MANUALLY move money between buckets
3. The benefit is PSYCHOLOGICAL and RISK MANAGEMENT
4. In down markets, you never sell from depleted buckets
5. Your timing (private stock year 5, inheritance year 10) makes it ideal

Think of it like having 3 checking accounts:
- One for this year's bills (Bucket 1)
- One for next decade's expenses (Bucket 2)  
- One for long-term growth (Bucket 3)

You manually move money between them based on performance!
